This is the FreeBSD OS-Selection menu. It is essentially a stripped-down
version of sysinstall(8), re-worked to display a simple-menu driven by a
single configuration file. See documentation in the sample configuration file
(`menu.conf.sample' in this directory) for additional information.

Currently, this source can only be compiled on FreeBSD-4.x. However, the
resulting compiled binary (`menu') is statically-linked and thus should work
fine regardless of the rutime environment so long as it is still FreeBSD.
