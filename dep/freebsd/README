$Header: /cvsroot/druidbsd/druidbsd/druid83/dep/freebsd/README,v 1.1 2012/10/10 23:29:56 devinteske Exp $

The files in this directory [and subsequent sub-directories] are required by
the FreeBSD portion of the DRUID installer.

For example, the sources required to build the files:

	druid/mdroot/boot/fis_mfsroot8.gz
	druid/mdroot/boot/rescue_mfsroot8.gz

are located in the `mfsroot' sub-directory of this directory.

While the above example is of an indirect dependency -- where the files
contained in the `mfsroot' sub-directory must be compiled on a FreeBSD
[compatible] Operating System then subsequently stored back to the source-
tree -- the sources contained in the `druid' sub-directory are an example of a
direct dependency. The `druid' sub-directory itself is copied recursively to
`src/freebsd/repos/*-{RELEASE,STABLE,CURRENT}/druid' during make(1) and is
deleted during `make clean' or `make distclean'.

For additional information, please reference the `README' file in each sub-
directory if/when available.
