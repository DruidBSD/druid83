This is a collection of small utilities used during the FreeBSD installation
process. For example, `swapsz' is used at install-time to determine how much
Swap-Space should be allocated for virtual memory on the system hard disk.

Not all of these utilities are used by Druid. This directory needs to be
cleaned up, with unused-aspects of the `util' collection being removed. Though,
the collection may end-up somewhere else in CVS as these utilities are still
very important in other areas of FreeBSD work (such as in package utilities --
namely `htt' which is incumbent to the FreeBSD-4.x kernel packages).
