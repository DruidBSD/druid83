Changes effecting only:
FreeBSD_Druid-1.0 [TBD]:

- Updated `find' routine in `src/freebsd/menu/etc/all_install' which searches
  `/dev' (DEVFS) to deprecate support for `wd#' (ST-506, ESDI, and IDE; read
  pre-ATA) and `fla#' (Disk-on-Chip) devices; while adding support for ada(4)
  (SATA disk) devices.
- Updated `src/freebsd/menu/etc/all_install' to enable Soft-Updates feature
  for the `/var', `/tmp', and `/usr' partitions.
  NOTE: Soft-Updates is a performance-enhancing feature required by RIDS that
  should be enabled for those partitions (though should NEVER be enabled for
  either the root [/] partition nor for external RAID storage arrays).
- The FreeBSD chain-loading process has been fixed to allow hybrid booting
  from either USB media or CD/DVD (with zero-modification to the ISO).
  NOTE: Simply `dd' the ISO onto your USB flash media
  DETAILS: Files modified include `fis_mfsroot8:fis/load_menu',
  `rescue_mfsroot8:fis/load_rescue', and `GNUmakefile.in'.
  MOTE DETAILS: FreeBSD-8.x kernel allows us to mount `/dev/iso9660/VOLID'
  as a cd9660 device (where `VOLID' is the internal IS9660 Volume ID/Label),
  even when booted from USB flash media.
- Patched/updated `src/freebsd/menu/menu' to remove `VBU' language
  NOTE: recompiled/linked on FreeBSD-8.0
- Removed additional `VBU' and `VICOR' language.
  DETAILS: Files modified include
  `src/freebsd/repos/4.8-RELEASE/util/etc/functions',
  `src/freebsd/repos/4.11-RELEASE/util/etc/functions',
  `src/freebsd/repos/8.0-RELEASE/util/etc/functions',
  `src/freebsd/menu/etc/functions',
  `src/frerebsd/menu/scripts/repair',
  `mdroot/boot/menu.rc',
  `src/freebsd/menu/etc/all_install',
  `src/freebsd/menu/scripts/standard411',
  `src/freebsd/menu/scripts/standard800',
  `src/freebsd/menu/scripts/standard480',
  `mdroot/boot/fis_mfsroot8.gz',
  `mdroot/boot/rescue_mfsroot8.gz',
  `fis_mfsroot8:install.cfg',
  `fis_mfsroot8:fis/functions',
  `fis_mfsroot8:fis/load_menu',
  `rescue_mfsroot8:fis/functions',
  `rescue_mfsroot8:fis/load_repair'.
  and `rescue_mfsroot8:stand/init',
- Created `src/freebsd/menu/scripts/standard800' bootstrap script. This script
  is called by `src/freebsd/menu/menu' in response to the user selecting the
  "Install FreeBSD-8.0" menu option.
- Created `src/freebsd/menu/etc/install800.conf' which is read by the bootstrap
  script `src/freebsd/menu/scripts/standard800'.
- Added `freebsd/repos/8.0-RELEASE' installation resources from the Walnut
  Creek FreeBSD-8.0 ("green disc") install CD-ROM.
- Deprecate `boot/freebsd/mdroot*.gz'. This compressed FreeBSD Memory File-
  System (MFS) was difficult to modify and even more difficult to maintain.
  Further, when booting from USB flash media, SYSLINUX had difficulty on some
  hardware in performing floppy-disk emulation with this image. This has been
  replaced with ISO chain-loading (NEW).
- NEW! ISO chain-loading. In updating SYSLINUX from version 3.82 to 3.84, we
  are now able to perform CD-ROM emulation via MEMDISK's new ISO driver. This
  makes our emulated boot-media (previously `boot/freebsd/mdroot*.gz' in MFS
  format) easier to modify and maintain.
  DETAILS: Our original emulated boot-media was a monolithic binary disk-image
  that could only be edited on FreeBSD systems. Everytime a change had to be
  made to the boot-loader code, the developer had to (a) upload the image to a
  FreeBSD system, (b) un-pack the image, (c) make the necessary modification,
  (d) re-pack the image, and finally (e) transfer the image back to the source
  directory where it needs to be. Meanwhile, our new emulated boot-media is
  compiled at build-time with the rest of the `make' process. When a change is
  needed to the boot-loader code, the developer can easily modify the code in
  `mdroot/' and simply re-`make' (modifying any file in the `mdroot' sources
  will cause the dependency-chain to be dirtied, causing subsequent rebuilding
  of the constituent ISO upon the next `make').
  NOTE: There is still a monolithic MFS image within the emulated boot-media.
  This has not changed, and may likely never change due to certain constructs
  (such as the ability to dynamically determine whether we booted from CD/DVD
  versus USB flash media and act appropriately) still being required even in
  the latest FreeBSD boot-code. What's worth noting here is that there are no-
  longer TWO of these images (the emulated boot-media used to be one of these,
  which in-turn contained another; this is, thankfully, no longer the case).
- New FreeBSD loader(8). `boot/loader' has been updated to the latest version.
  Previously we were using loader(8) from FreeBSD-4.11. We are now using
  loader(8) from FreeBSD-8.0. This change was necessary to fix booting from
  USB flash media AND from the new CD-ROM emulation (using new ISO driver).
  NOTE: This change brought in its own set of challenges (see below).
- Update various ANS/FICL Forth (`*.4th') modules to work with new loader(8).
  NOTE: ANSI color-code definitions changed in loader(8) from RELENG_4 to
  RELENG_8 in that the later code (RELENG_8) properly understands all Standard
  codes whereas the older code-line foisted its own (non-Standard) definitions.
  In addition, `number?' is no longer a valid Forth word and has been
  deprecated in favor of `?number'.
  DETAILS: The following files needed updating with respect to ANSI color-
  codes: `boot/include/beastie.4th', `boot/include/brand.4th',
  `boot/include/menu-commands.4th', and `boot/include/version.4th'.
  Meanwhile, the following files needed updating with respect to `?number'
  (new) versus `number?' (old) usage: `boot/include/beastie.4th',
  `boot/include/brand.4th', `boot/include/dc_execute.4th',
  `boot/include/menu.4th', and `boot/include/version.4th'.
  MORE DETAILS: The `?number' (new) and `number?' (old) words are different
  in that the old word returned `-1' to the stack if the C-Addr string did NOT
  represent a signed integer, meanwhile the new word returns 1. This had a
  negative impact on code in both `boot/include/beastie.4th' and
  `boot/include/brand.4th', where actual functionality had to be patched (not
  just the word-name).
- Added `mdroot/boot/loader.help' to support loader(8)'s `help' feature (new
  to FreeBSD-8.0).
- Added `mdroot/boot/cdboot' as our El Torito boot image.
  DETAILS: With our new SYSLINUX ISO chain-loading, we need to use FreeBSD's
  `cdboot' image whereas with our old MEMDISK Floppy emulation, we executed
  `boot/loader' directly.
- Modified `boot/menu.rc' (now within `mdroot' sources). Changed the menu
  text for "Boot" to "Boot [ENTER]". Changed "Kernel Type:" to "Kernel:".
  Changed kernel paths (4.8/4.11 kernels are deprecated and will no longer
  be used; going forward we are locked into using 8.0+). Changed kernel-
  selection menu handling. Updated ANSI color codes for new loader(8).
- Renamed boot/mfsroot.gz (formerly in mdroot.gz; now in `mdroot/boot') from
  `mfsroot.gz' to `fis_mfsroot8.gz'.
  NOTE: This was necessary to help identify "at a glance" that the binary MFS
  disk image is both (a) of our design (indicated by the `fis_' prefix) and
  (b) of FreeBSD-8.x origin (indicated by the `8' suffix).
- Renamed/moved the kernels. The new location for the kernels is a directory
  at `/kernels' (within the new `mdroot' sources). The new naming convention is
  "CONFIGNAME-RELpN[.kgz]" (where CONFIGNAME should be the same as the kernel's
  `ident' configuration name). For example, we're starting off with
  `FIS-8.0p1.kgz', `FIS-PAE-8.0p1.kgz', and `GENERIC-8.0p1.kgz'.
  DETAILS: Traditionally stored at the root as either "kernel-x.y.kgz" and
  "kernel-1.9.smp.kgz", I've decided that we need a better naming convention
  (and new location). The traditional names do nothing for indicating what
  FreeBSD release the kernel came from. Similarly, there will be a push to
  continue this naming convention in the production environment (not just the
  install platform). Further, within the production environment, the package
  that will be used to install our kernels will also be renamed. Currently,
  custom kernels for a particular FreeBSD release are installed via a package
  named similar to "FreeBSD???-Kernel-Vicor-X.Y" and this needs to change
  because (a) we modify the kernel rarely and cannot perceive a 2.0 release
  (not without all that a "2.0" release implies when using MAJOR.MINOR version
  strings) and (b) packages beginning with "FreeBSD???-" in their name should
  be classified as "one-off" packages (for example, a security update for a
  particular FreeBSD release). With regard to the latter, every release of
  FreeBSD since 4.8 has had a custom kernel, and it is therefore prudent that
  we move the kernel package to a more forward-looking package name
  (`fis_kernel-*') which we can expect to exist for all releases.
  NOTE: For argument-sake, if we were to retroactively apply this change in
  our older production environments, we'd see the files `kernels/VICOR-4.11p1'
  and `kernels/VICOR-SMP-4.11p1', followed by the older `kernels/VICOR-4.8p8'
  and `kernels/VICOR-SMP-4.8p8'. Simply-put, if one were to slam all the
  kernels into the same directory, you should still be able to (at-a-glance)
  tell which kernel pertains to which FreeBSD release and what the FIS
  patch-level of that kernel is.
- Updated `mdroot/boot/include/menu-commands.4th' to set proper mount root
  device name (this changed from "ufs:md1" to "ufs:/dev/md0" when we pulled-in
  the new loader(8) from FreeBSD-8.0, replacing our old FreeBSD-4.11 loader).
- Deprecated `boot/freebsd/mdroot-rescue-1.1.gz' in favor of a unified
  `boot/freebsd/mdroot.iso' which contains new boot-loader code (detailed
  below) that allows the user to select which mfsroot image to boot from.
  NOTE: The deprecated image (`mdroot-rescue-1.1.gz') was, except for one line
  of code, exactly the same as the normal boot image.
  DETAILS: The addition of the `cycle_menuitem' ANS/Forth word in the module
  `mdroot/boot/include/menu-commands.4th' (for the purpose of allowing multiple
  kernel choice in the boot-loader) facilitated the ability to consolidate
  these two (very similar) images into one.
- Modified `mdroot/boot/include/menu-commands.4th', adding the `cycle_menuitem'
  word to the ANS/Forth dictionary. Similar to the `toggle_menuitem' word, the
  `cycle_menuitem' word is an abstract routine that handles the heavy-lifting
  involved in tracking the current state of any given menuitem. Further, the
  `toggle_kernel' routine has been replaced by a new `cycle_kernel' routine
  which relies on the new `cycle_menuitem' word. See `mdroot/boot/menu.rc' for
  more information.

Changes effecting both:
FreeBSD_Druid-1.0 [TBD]:
Druid_Tools-1.0 [TBD]:

- New build architecture. The `make' process has been completely rewritten.
  NOTE: The new process allows for better dependency handling. Namely, the
  developer can now rebuild without recompiling everything in the tree (only
  modified components are rebuilt). Developers are now required to execute
  "./configure" (without quotes) prior to `make' (see the README file).
  DETAILS: `GNUmakefile' has been replaced with a suite of files containing
  `GNUmakefile.in', `configure.in', `configure', `cfgaux/config.guess',
  `cfgaux/config.sub', and `cfgaux/install-sh'.
- Updated SYSLINUX from version 3.82 to 3.84 (bug fixes, newer HDT, new ISO
  driver, etc.).
- Updated Hardware Detection Tool (HDT) from version 0.3.3 to 0.3.6
  DETAILS: Files modified include `src/boot/isolinux/hdt.c32' and
  `src/boot/other/isolinux.cfg'
- Added `TODO' file for tracking things that need to be done.
- Updated color-scheme of isolinux boot menu (FIS Branding Guide 2.23.10)
  DETAILS: Files modified include `src/boot/include/fis.jpg' and
  `src/boot/include/isolinux-menu.cfg'
- Removed additional `VBU' and `VICOR' language.
  DETAILS: Files modified include `src/boot/isolinux/menu.cfg',
  `src/boot/isolinux/menu.cfg.freebsd', `src/boot/isolinux/menu.cfg.linux',
  and `src/boot/isolinux/menu.cfg.tools'.
- Updated documentation.
  NOTE: Changed document name from to `FreeBSD_Druid_User_Guide' in accordance
  with new CRM guidelines.
  DETAILS: Updated graphics, language, copyright notice, layout, and version
  information in accordance with new CRM guidelines.
- Designed new ASCII art approximation of FIS logo for FreeBSD mid-boot menu
  (removing old "VBU" portion of the header).
  DETAILS: Files modified include `mdroot/boot/include/brand.4th' and
  `mdroot/boot/menu.rc'



Changes above are in relation to Universal Installer version 1.9 (FreeBSD),
released on October 7th, 2009.
