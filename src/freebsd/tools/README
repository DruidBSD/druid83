The scripts in this directory are to be used by field engineers and system
administrators for various purposes. Detailed descriptions of each scripts'
purpose and syntax/usage are as follows:

jail_build [OPTIONS]

	Use this script to build a new jailed guest-OS on the host-OS. The
	jail_build script must be run on FreeBSD 8.x or earlier from within
	this [tools] directory.

	OPTIONS:
		-h    Print this message to stderr and exit.
		-v    Verbose. Enables verbose output during build.
		-q    Quiet. Disables verbose output.

	ENVIRONMENT:
	  JAIL_BUILD_REPOS      Location of FreeBSD repository where binary
	                        distributions are held (default:`/usr/repos').
	  JAIL_BUILD_DESTDIR    Default directory to build new jails in
	                        (default: `/usr/jail').
	  JAIL_BUILD_VERBOSE    Verbosity. Must be zero or one (default: `0').
	  DIALOG_TMPDIR         Directory to store dialog(1) temporary files
	                        (default: `/tmp').

host_rebuild [OPTIONS] [-r RELEASE] [DESTDIR]

	OPTIONS:
		-h    Print this message to stderr and exit.
		-v    Verbose. Enables verbose output during build.
		-q    Quiet. Disables verbose output.
		-n    Don't actually do anything but show what will be done.

	ARGUMENTS:
          -r RELEASE   Specifies the FreeBSD release to rebuild. For example,
                       "8.1-RELEASE". If not specified, the user will be
	               prompted to select the release from a list of available
	               options.
          DESTDIR      Directory to unpack chosen-release to (defaults is `/').

	ENVIRONMENT:
          HOST_REBUILD_VERBOSE   Verbosity. Must be zero or one (default: `0').
          DIALOG_TMPDIR          Directory to store dialog(1) temporary files
                                 (default: `/tmp').

	EXAMPLES:

		host_rebuild
		    Prompts the user to select a release from a list and then
		    rebuilds the base host using the chosen release. Releases
		    are located in `../repos', relative to script-location.
        
		host_rebuild -r 8.1-RELEASE
		    Rebuilds the base host as FreeBSD-8.1.
        
		host_rebuild -r 8.1-RELEASE /usr/vm/kws7p
		    Rebuilds the jailed host (/usr/vm/kws7p) as FreeBSD-8.1.
